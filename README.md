1. Encapsulation in Personal Budget Management- I developed a Personal Budget Management application. This app handles various budget categories such as food, entertainment, utilities, and more, ensuring that the budget details stay private and can only be accessed or modified via public methods.
2. E-commerce Product Catalog System- I developed a system that manages various product types, including books, electronics, and clothing.
